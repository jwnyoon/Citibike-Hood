This project is a data analysis and visualization project using CitiBike data.
I did this projectat Cloud Commuting class 2014 Fall semester. I wanted to find if there are communities of CitiBike stations based on bike trips between stations and what this pattern tell us about why people are using CitiBike. 
I analyzed Citibike trip data to define groups and networks and mapped this data using Mapbox on the web.
